Travis Cloud Images
===================

Travis Cloud Images is a simple tool to help provision and manage cloud VMs and templates.

Currently only the Blue Box provider is supported, but this may be extended in the future.

Many more features are left to be added, and lots more awesome is in the works.

High 5 !
